# This code creates a simple text editor using Tkinter with basic file operations and editing features.
# It includes a menu bar for file and edit operations, supports keyboard shortcuts,
# and handles unsaved changes before exiting or opening new files.
# The text editor can open, save, and create new files, and it uses a scrolled text area for editing.
# The code is structured to be clear and maintainable, with error handling for file operations.
# Note: Ensure you have Tkinter installed and available in your Python environment to run this code.
# The code is designed to be run as a standalone script.
# It can be easily extended with more features like find/replace, font customization, etc.
